â–¶ The Toyota Prius is the best-selling hybrid car,accounting for 30% of all hybrid sales. 
Hybrid cars popularity is driven by its exceptional fuel efficiency, low emissions, and reputation for reliablity.
â–¶ Fuel Efficiency: Hybrid cars leads with an estimated 40-60 MPG City, 50-66 MPG Highway.
â–¶ Emissions: Toyota Prius has the lowest emissions among all hybrid models.

Recommendation:
I recommend investing in marketing campaigns that highlight the environmental benefits and cost savings of hybrid vehicles, particularly among eco-conscious and budget-minded consumers.

* The high horsepower car market is highly concentrated, this suggests a significant barrier to entry for new manufacturers, and opportunities for market share gains through strategic partnerships or acquisitions.
 * cars with horsepower(>500hp) are primarily driven by emotional purchases, with 80% buyers citing "Performmance" and "Status" as key motivations. This highlight an opportunity for manufacturers to focus on experiential marketing and brand storytelling to connect with these enthusiasts.
